# Daga-Rename

Bulk Photo Rename cli tool

The program renames all provided photos to a following format `YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss_ID.extension`. If there is no creation time in the metadata of the photo, the file will be omitted.

# Usage

The program is launched from the command line. It requires at least one argument which is the directory you want to be changed.

`Daga-Rename '/path/to/photo 1.jpg'`

If you want to add an ID tag at the end of the filename, then specify the ID using `-` character in the first argument. The ID is optional and does not need to be provided.

`Daga-Rename -ID '/path/to/photo 1.jpg'`

The same works with folders and multiple directories specified in the next arguments passed to the program.

`Daga-Rename -ID '/path/to/photo 1.jpg' '/path/to/photo 2.jpg' '/path/to/folder 1' '/path/to/folder 2'`

`Daga-Rename '/path/to/photo 1.jpg' '/path/to/photo 2.jpg' '/path/to/folder 1' '/path/to/folder 2'`

If you are uncertain on how to use this program then run `Daga-Rename help` to see a quick manual.

If there's no date of shooting the photo then the file will be omitted.
